# Project-RestaurantWeb
This project is strictly front-end focused and does not include backend functionality such as databases, authentication, or payment processing. Its purpose is to demonstrate front-end development skills and UI/UX principles.

Restaurant Food Ordering Interface (Front-End Only):
A restaurant food ordering interface is a front-end web interface that allows users to browse a restaurant’s menu, view food images and prices, and interact with items in a visually clear and user-friendly way. The interface focuses on menu presentation, layout design, and user interaction, without handling actual payments or server-side processing. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate front-end development concepts such as layout structuring, styling, animations, and DOM manipulation.
